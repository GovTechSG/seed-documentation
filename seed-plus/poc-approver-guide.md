# Approver guide (Point-of-Contact)

In SEED+, any action that requires elevated privileges (e.g. software installations, configuration changes) must be reviewed and approved by a Point-of-Contact (PoC).

This guide explains your responsibilities and how to handle elevation requests.

---

## Role of a PoC

As the designated PoC:

- You are notified via email whenever a developer requests elevation.
- You decide whether to approve or reject each request based on project relevance and security.
- Your decision is logged and auditable by system administrators.

---

## Approving or rejecting a request

1. You will receive an **email notification** with the request details.
2. Click the link in the email to **view the request in the CyberArk portal**.
3. Review:
   - Who made the request
   - The command or application being elevated
   - Justification provided (if any)
4. Choose to **approve** or **reject** the request.

> Your decision will be sent back to the requestor immediately. Approved actions will proceed without further input.

## Tips for good decision-making

- Only approve requests related to project work.
- Be cautious if the justification is vague or missing.
- If unsure, contact the developer before approving.
- Reject requests that involve unsafe or unverified tools.
