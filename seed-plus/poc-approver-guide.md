# SEED+ â€“ POC approver guide

This guide is for point-of-contact (POC) approvers who manage and approve elevation requests from offshore developers via CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM).

## Typical elevation requests

Examples of elevation requests that may require your approval:

## Just-in-time (JIT) access elevation

### What is JIT access elevation?

Just-in-time (JIT) access elevation allows temporary administrative rights to be granted to users on a per-request basis. This ensures that elevated privileges are only provided when needed and for a limited duration, reducing the risk of persistent admin access on SEED+ devices.

### JIT approval flow

1. You will receive a JIT email notification.

   ![CyberArk login](../images/seed-plus/poc-approval/cyberark-login.png)

4. Go to **Events Management** > Click **All filters** > Check **With justification** > Click **Apply**.

   ![JIT policy screen](../images/seed-plus/poc-approval/jit-policy.png)

7. Under **Permissions (Local Groups)**:
   - Add `admin` for macOS
   - Add `Administrators` for Windows

8. Click **Create**, then **Confirm**.

## Reminders for POC approvers

- **Check justification** before approving any request.
- **Elevation is temporary**: Each JIT policy is valid for **24 hours only**.
- **Inform the user** once the request is approved.
- Use **admin** (macOS) or **Administrators** (Windows) when assigning permissions.
