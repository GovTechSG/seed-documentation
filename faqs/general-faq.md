# General FAQ

<details><summary>What data can I store on a Government Managed Device (GMD)?</summary>

GMDs are intended to facilitate development work for accessing GCC 2.0 and SGTS securely. Do not store production or live data on GMDs.

</details>

<details><summary>Can I install unlicensed software or tools on my Government Managed Device (GMD)?</summary>

Installing unlicensed software on your GMD is strictly prohibited. GMDs are government-managed, and this policy ensures security and compliance. Unauthorised software compromises security and violates regulations. 

If you need a particular software for your development work, please follow your organisation's processes to obtain the legitimate version. Refer to [Terms of policies](/additional-resources/terms-and-policies.md)for details.

<details><summary>I have lost my Government Managed Device (GMD). What should I do?</summary>

1. Notify your manager and operations manager to approve data deletion on the lost device.
2. [Raise a service request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) to notify the SEED team about the lost device.
3. Mention any sensitive data in the request to prioritise remote wiping.
4. Attach manager approvals for necessary actions to prevent data breaches.

</details>

<details><summary>What happens when the security of a Government Managed Device (GMD) is compromised?</summary>

  When SEED detects a compromised device, it contacts the owner for disconnection. After obtaining owner and manager approvals, SEED performs a remote wipe.

> **Note**: 
> The device must be powered on and connected to the internet for remote wiping.

</details>
<details><summary>What happens when a remote wipe is performed on a Government Managed Device (GMD)?</summary>

  Remote wipe erases all data on the device, performed only for theft, loss, or security compromise. For more information, refer to the [Terms and policies](/additional-resources/terms-and-policies).

</details>
<details><summary>Is remote wipe done only on devices that belong to public sector agencies?</summary>

  No, remote wipe applies to any lost or compromised GMD to prevent data breaches. For more information, refer to the [Terms and policies](/additional-resources/terms-and-policies).

</details>

<details><summary>What should I do if my device has been inactive for 180 days?</summary>

If your device is no longer required to access SEED, please offboard your device. For detailed steps on offboarding your Mac, click [here](/offboard-device/macos-offboarding-guide.md), and for Windows, click [here](/offboard-device/windows-offboarding-guide.md). If you still require access after being inactive for 180 days, please email enquiries_seed@tech.gov.sg for assistance.

</details>

<details><summary>What should I do if I want to check if my device record has been deleted?</summary>

Log in to [SEED Dashboard](https://dashboard.seed.tech.gov.sg/) after 26 October 2023 to see whether your device record still exists. If your device record does not exist, or you are unable to log into SEED Dashboard, your device records have been cleaned up.

</details>

<details><summary>What should I do if my device record has been deleted even though it is still active?</summary>

Please email enquiries_seed@tech.gov.sg for assistance.

</details>

<details><summary>Why am I prompted to turn on my system integrity protection on my macOS device?</summary>

  This is a SEED policy requirement. System Integrity Protection enhances macOS security and is designed to help prevent potentially malicious software from modifying protected files and folders on your macOS. System Integrity Protection restricts the root user account and limits the actions that the root user can perform on protected parts of the macOS.

<details><summary>Why do I need to turn on File Vault encryption?</summary>

  FileVault encryption is essential to ensure device security and compliance.

 </details>

<details><summary>Why does my device slow down after onboarding to Microsoft Intune?</summary>

 SEED uses **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** for security. Other antivirus software may impact performance. Disable or uninstall non-**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** antivirus software.

 </details>

<details><summary>Previously, I have successfully onboarded my Internet Device to SEED, but now I received an email indicating limited access to SEED-protected resources. Why, and what should I do? </summary>

This suggests SEED detected device configuration issues. For example, an unhealthy Microsoft Defender. For resolution:

- Offboard your device if access is no longer needed.

- [Raise a service request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) to restore access to SEED-protected resources. Specify that your SEED access was revoked due to device misconfiguration, allowing us to process the request accordingly.

</details>

<details><summary>Why did I receive the successfully onboarded email again?</summary>

Receiving this email again indicates that services ensuring SEED compliance may have had configuration issues, temporarily affecting SEED access.

</details>

<details><summary>Do I need to re-onboard my device to SEED after returning from a long leave?</summary>

If you belong to the TechPass Entra ID and your GMD has not been logged into for 90 consecutive days, the GMD becomes inactive, and its' records are softly removed from the Intune portal.

It is important to understand that when your device records are softly removed, it does not perform a device wipe or retirement. Instead, the device record is temporarily taken out of Intune.

Consequently, SEED administrators will no longer have access to details such as the device's health status, and they will not be able to manage it from the SEED Dashboard.

</details>

<details><summary>Will I receive any notification of MDM certificate expiration?</summary>

No, you will not receive any notification for this.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to change my SEED onboarding password after a year, and what are the password requirements for it?</summary>
