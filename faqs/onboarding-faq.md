  <summary>Why is Microsoft Defender not automatically installed after enrolling in Company Portal?</summary>

  This can happen if Defender or any other antivirus solution previously installed on the device was not completely removed before onboarding to SEED. Please verify that Microsoft Defender is correctly configured on your device.

  For detailed steps on verifying Microsoft Defender on your device, please refer to the appropriate guide:
    - [macOS 14 and 13](/post-onboarding-instructions/macos-latest.md)

  <summary>While onboarding to Microsoft Intune, I receive an error message: "Could not download the identity profile from the Encrypted Profile Service. The credentials within the Device Enrolment profile may have expired." What should I do?</summary>

  One possible reason for this error is that your device may have been previously onboarded to Microsoft Intune by a different user and was not properly offboarded during the pre-onboarding steps.

  To confirm this, please [raise a service request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) and provide your device's serial number. The SEED team will investigate whether your device was previously enrolled in Microsoft Intune under a different user.

  If this is confirmed, you can choose one of the following options to offboard your device from Microsoft Intune and then retry the SEED onboarding process:

  - For Windows users, refer to the [SEED offboarding steps for Windows](/offboard-device/windows-offboarding-guide.md).
  - For macOS users, go to **System Preferences** and locate the old Management Profile. Follow the [SEED offboarding steps for macOS](/offboard-device/macos-offboarding-guide.md).
</details>
  
<details>
  <summary>What should I do if my device is not automatically renamed after SEED onboarding?</summary>

  This can happen if Defender or any other antivirus already installed on the device was not completely removed before onboarding to SEED. To confirm this, verify if Microsoft Defender is configured correctly on your device.
