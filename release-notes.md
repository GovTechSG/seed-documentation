| **New feature** | **Roll out of egress static IPs** | This a long awaited feature. We have rolled out egress to all SEED users. While this feature does not affect the majority of SEED users, it improves the integration between SEED and some services that do not support integration with Cloudflare. If you have such a requirement to secure your environment, please get in touch with us through our SEED mailbox at:<br/> [enquiries_seed@tech.gov.sg](mailto:enquiries_seed@tech.gov.sg).|
