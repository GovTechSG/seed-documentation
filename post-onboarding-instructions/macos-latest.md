6. Open Cloudflare WARP **Settings**, and ensure **Gateway with WARP** is selected. WARP is now active, safeguarding your Internet connection.

## Verify Microsoft Defender is configured

1. Open **Terminal** and run `mdatp health`.
2. Take note of the value displayed for **org_id**.

> **Note**: If this command does not return anything, it indicates your device does not have Defender. [Proceed to onboard your macOS device to SEED](/onboard-device/identify-onboarding-persona).

Identify the organisation corresponding to this **org_id** from the following table. This is the organisation of the Defender or the antivirus on your device.

| org_id  | Organisation |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| faa36a5e-2da6-4225-8e27-226177c801a0      | WOG     |
| 49237d71-42ac-425a-a803-881b92cc18ce  | TechPass    |
| 6389e966-e334-461d-86ce-0fed12484620      | Hive    |

4. Choose the required step from the following:

- If your organisation id corresponds to WOG or TechPass, it indicates that **Microsoft Defender** has been configured correctly and you can ignore the rest of this section.

- If your organisation id corresponds to Hive, it indicates that your device is still enrolled with Hive. Contact [Hive support](mailto:GDS_DEN@hive.gov.sg) to retrieve the offboarding package to unenrol your device. Refer to [Offboarding FAQ](faq/offboarding-faq.md) for more details.
    
 - If your device is enrolled with a different MDM, contact your organisation IT support to unenrol your device from it.

Within the next few hours, **Intune** pushes the **Microsoft Defender** client to your device with the correct configurations. For more information on the duration, refer to [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot#how-long-does-it-take-for-devices-to-get-a-policy-profile-or-app-after-they-are-assigned).

At any time, users can sign in to Company Portal app, click the three dots and choose **Check status** to check for policy or profile updates. It may take a while to complete the synchronisation. When completed, the screen will show the timestamp of the last successful sync.
