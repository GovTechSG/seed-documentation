# Onboard to SEED as a public officer

This document provides a step-by-step guide to help public officers through the onboarding process for the Secure Engineering Environment for Developers (SEED). Before proceeding, make sure you meet the prerequisites outlined below.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the SEED (Secure Engineering Environment for Developers) onboarding process as a public officer, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Your TechPass login ID must match your work email, typically associated with a WOG (Whole-of-Government) account. For example, john_doe@moe.gov.sg or john_doe_from.cognizant@tech.gov.sg.


## macOS

During the process, you may encounter prompts to restart your device and reset your device's password. It is important to have your recovery keys ready in case you encounter any issues during the password reset or device login.

1. Open **Terminal** and run the following commands:

```
intune_id="$(security find-certificate -a /Library/Keychains/System.keychain | egrep -B 4 '\"issu\"<blob>=.+MICROSOFT INTUNE MDM DEVICE CA' | grep alis | cut -d '"' -f 4)"
if [ -z "$intune_id" ]
then
    echo "Intune ID not found"
    return
fi

num_candidates="$(echo "$intune_id" | wc -l | xargs echo -n)"
if [ "$num_candidates" -eq 1 ]
then
    echo "$intune_id"
    return
fi

old_ifs="$IFS"
IFS='\n'
actual_id="Intune ID not found"
curr_latest_end_date_unix=0
while read id
do
    end_date="$(security find-certificate -c "$id" -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain | openssl x509 -noout -enddate | cut -d '=' -f 2)"
    end_date_unix="$(date -j -f "%b %e %H:%M:%S %Y %Z" "$end_date" "+%s")"
    if [ "$end_date_unix" -ge "$curr_latest_end_date_unix" ]
    then

### Step 3: Register Microsoft Intune Device ID


<details>
  <summary style="font-size:18px">Register the Microsoft Intune Device ID for your Windows device.</summary>

1. Open **PowerShell** and run the following commands:
```
$rootKey = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]::OpenBaseKey(
    [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryHive]::LocalMachine,
    [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryView]::Registry64
)
$enrollmentsKey = $rootKey.OpenSubKey("Software\Microsoft\Enrollments")
$intune_id = "Intune ID not found"
foreach ($name in $enrollmentsKey.GetSubKeyNames()) {
    $enrollmentIdKey = $enrollmentsKey.OpenSubKey($name)
    if ($enrollmentIdKey.GetValue("ProviderID") -ieq "MS DM Server") {
        $intune_id = $enrollmentIdKey.OpenSubKey("DMClient\MS DM Server").GetValue("EntDMID", "Intune ID not found")
        break
    }
}
Write-Output $intune_id
```
2. Take note of the Intune Device ID that is displayed on the Powershell window.

3. Choose the appropriate method to register your Intune Device ID:

    a. If you only have a **SE GSIB** device, [raise a service request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) to register your Intune Device ID and skip rest of the steps. Within two hours, you should receive the successfully onboarded email.

    b. If you have a **non-SE GSIB/COMET** device, log in to the [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/secure/account/profile).

4. On the TechPass portal, at the top right, go to your user name and click **My Account**. Your **Profile** details are displayed. 
5. Click **Onboard device to SEED** and follow the on-screen instructions to submit this Intune Device ID.

  You will receive the following confirmation message.

  ![ack-of-intune-device-id](../images/ack-of-intune-device-id.png)

  Your Internet Device record is listed under the **SEED Devices** with the following details:

    - Device name
    - Operating system of the device
    - Serial number
    - Intune Device ID
    - Date and time when the onboarding was trigerred or when the device was successfully onboarded

7. After 30-60 minutes, check your inbox (organisational email address) to see if you have received any email regarding your onboarding status.

8. Choose the appropriate step:

   a. If you have received a successfully onboarded email, skip rest of the steps in this section and proceed to [Step 3: Verify installation](#step-3-verify-installation).

    b. If you have **not yet received** the **successfully onboarded email** or if you **have received** a **failed onboarding email**, complete the following step on [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/).

  You may receive a desktop notification that your device has been renamed according to convention, and that a timed restart will occur in 5 minutes. This is completely expected, and you should save any existing work to prevent data loss. Alternatively, you can also opt to manually restart your device, after receiving the desktop notification, to speed up the process. As the naming convention is required for administrative purposes, please refrain from renaming your device thereafter.
