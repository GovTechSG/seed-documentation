This guide provides solutions to common problems for SEED. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the problems you are experiencing.

## Resolving *Cloudflare CF_DNS_Lookup_Failure* error on macOS 15

![Firewall settings](/images/cferror.png)

If you encounter the `CF_DNS_Lookup_Failure` error while using Cloudflare WARP on macOS 15, follow these steps to resolve the issue:


### Upgrade macOS
Cloudflare recommends upgrading to **macOS 15.1 or later**, as macOS 15.1 resolves several issues that could cause the WARP client to misbehave.

- Open **System Preferences**.
- Select **Software Update**.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to update to **macOS 15.1 or later**.

### Enable firewall settings

Ensure your firewall settings are properly configured to allow Cloudflare WARP to function.

- Open **System Preferences**.
- Navigate to **Settings > Network > Firewall**.
- Turn on the firewall.

![Firewall settings](/images/firewall-macos15.png)


### Disable *block all incoming connections*
Adjust your firewall settings to allow incoming connections.

- Go to **Settings > Network > Firewall > Options**.
- Ensure **"Block all incoming connections"** is **unchecked**.


### Allow incoming connections for Cloudflare WARP
Enable incoming connections explicitly for the following applications:

1. **CloudflareWARP** located at:  
   `/Applications/CloudflareWARP.app/Contents/Resources/CloudflareWARP`
2. **Cloudflare WARP** with the bundle ID:  
   `com.cloudflare.1dot1dot1dot1dot1.macos`

![Allow incoming connections](/images/allow-warp.png)

After completing these steps, the `CF_DNS_Lookup_Failure` error should no longer occur.


## Troubleshooting access issues for SGTS Resources

If you encounter the screen below:

![Error Screen](/images/cf-i1.png)

Follow these steps to diagnose the issue:

1. **Check the SEED Dashboard**: Start by investigating the reason why access to certain resources is restricted. Ensure the following:

   - Your Cloudflare WARP client is connected and enrolled in the `gccgovsg` organisation.
   - The Tanium Client is installed and running on your device.

Once these conditions are met, you can access the SEED Dashboard on your GMD to further diagnose the issue with your device.

### Possible reasons for blocking

Access to SGTS resources may be blocked for the following reasons:

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Category** |
|---|---|---|
| Malware on the device | The device is infected with malware or exhibits suspicious behavior, causing it to be classified as high-risk and blocking access to SGTS. | Security |
| Incorrect Cloudflare configuration | The Cloudflare WARP client is either stopped or not enrolled in the `gccgovsg` organization, marking the device as misconfigured. | Configuration |
| Incorrect Intune configuration | Device not enrolled in the correct tenants (`SG Govt M365` or `TECHPASS`), or unable to sync with Intune, blocking access to resources. | Configuration |
| Tanium Client cannot communicate | The Tanium Client is unable to communicate with our servers, leading to blocked access due to lack of necessary status updates.| Configuration |


## Tanium issues

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Windows**

**Check for Tanium Client installation**

1. Click the Start icon on the taskbar.
2. Go to *Settings* > *Apps* and search for Tanium Client.
   
![tanium](/images/tanium-client-win.png)

3. If you are unable to find it, try to resync your Intune to install the Tanium Client on your device.

### **macOS**

**Check for Tanium Client installation**

1. Open *Terminal*.
2. Eun the following command:
   ```sudo ls /Library/Tanium/TaniumClient```
3. Enter your macOS password when prompted.
4. If you see confirmation, as shown in the image below, Tanium Client is installed on your device.
![tanium-client](/images/tanium-client-mac.png)
5. If you are unable to find it, log into Company Portal to install the Tanium Client on your device. Otherwise, you might need to re-onboard your device following the steps [here](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/onboard-device/seed-prerequisites).


<!-- tabs:end -->

## Other Tanium issues

If your device remains blocked after checking all other settings, please try to connect using a mobile hotspot and wait for 15-20 minutes for the Tanium server to find your device.

If your device is unblocked after connecting via mobile hotspot, it is likely that the firewall of the previous network you are connecting to is blocking the Tanium IPs. Whitelist the Tanium IPs to resolve this issue. The IP addresses can be found at this [link](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/tanium-ip/README) (accessible via TechPass login).
