# Troubleshooting issues

This guide provides solutions to common problems for SEED. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the problems you are experiencing.

## Unable to log in to MacBook – login loop

This issue commonly occurs on devices with outdated macOS versions. To resolve it, please upgrade your macOS to version 15.1.1 or later.

### Suggested steps

1. **Log in and upgrade macOS**
   - Attempt to log in to the MacBook a few times using the correct password. Once logged in, upgrade your macOS.
   - Alternatively, log in with a different user account (if available). Once logged in, upgrade your macOS.

2. **Reset password in recovery mode**
   - If you are unable to log in at all, reset your password using recovery mode. Follow the steps in [Apple’s guide to resetting passwords](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/102673). Once the password is reset, log in and upgrade your macOS.

### Recovery mode instructions

Follow the steps below depending on your Mac model. If you are unsure whether your Mac uses Apple silicon, you can try both sets of steps.

#### For Macs with Apple silicon

1. Shut down your Mac. If you are unable to shut it down normally, press and hold the power button for up to 10 seconds until it turns off. (On laptops with Touch ID, press and hold the Touch ID button.)
2. Press and hold the power button. Continue holding it until your Mac turns on and displays the startup options screen. When you see **Options**, release the power button.
3. Click **Options**, then click the **Continue** button below it.

#### For other Mac models

1. Shut down your Mac. If you are unable to shut it down normally, press and hold the power button for up to 10 seconds until it turns off. (On laptops with Touch ID, press and hold the Touch ID button.)
2. Press and release the power button to turn on your Mac.
3. Immediately after releasing the power button, press and hold **Command (⌘)-R** on your keyboard.
4. Keep holding the keys until you see the Apple logo or a spinning globe.
5. If your Mac starts up to the login window again, review the [startup key combinations guide](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201255), then start again from step 1.

### Reset password in recovery mode

1. From the **Utilities** menu in the menu bar, select **Terminal**.
2. In the Terminal window, type `resetpassword` and press **Return**. This will open the Reset Password assistant.
3. If prompted to select an admin user, click **Forgotten all passwords?**.
4. At the Reset Password window:
   - Click **Deactivate Mac**, then confirm by clicking **Deactivate**.
   - If the Activation Lock window appears, enter your Apple ID credentials and click **Next**.
5. Enter your new password information. If multiple user accounts are listed, click **Set Password** next to each account name and provide a new password for each.
6. When finished, click **Exit**, then restart your Mac from the **Apple menu > Restart**. Log in with your new password.

### Reinstall macOS if necessary

If you are still unable to log in, reinstall macOS through recovery mode. Refer to [Apple’s guide on reinstalling macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/102655).


## Resolving *Cloudflare CF_DNS_Lookup_Failure* error on macOS 15

![Firewall settings](/images/cferror.png)

If you encounter the `CF_DNS_Lookup_Failure` error while using Cloudflare WARP on macOS 15, follow these steps to resolve the issue:


### Upgrade macOS
Cloudflare recommends upgrading to **macOS 15.1 or later**, as macOS 15.1 resolves several issues that could cause the WARP client to misbehave.

- Open **System Preferences**.
- Select **Software Update**.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to update to **macOS 15.1 or later**.

### Enable firewall settings

Ensure your firewall settings are properly configured to allow Cloudflare WARP to function.

- Open **System Preferences**.
- Navigate to **Settings > Network > Firewall**.
- Turn on the firewall.

![Firewall settings](/images/firewall-macos15.png)


### Disable *block all incoming connections*
Adjust your firewall settings to allow incoming connections.

- Go to **Settings > Network > Firewall > Options**.
- Ensure **"Block all incoming connections"** is **unchecked**.


### Allow incoming connections for Cloudflare WARP
Enable incoming connections explicitly for the following applications:

1. **CloudflareWARP** located at:  
   `/Applications/CloudflareWARP.app/Contents/Resources/CloudflareWARP`
2. **Cloudflare WARP** with the bundle ID:  
   `com.cloudflare.1dot1dot1dot1dot1.macos`

![Allow incoming connections](/images/allow-warp.png)

After completing these steps, the `CF_DNS_Lookup_Failure` error should no longer occur.


## Troubleshooting access issues for SGTS Resources

If you encounter the screen below:

![Error Screen](/images/cf-i1.png)

Follow these steps to diagnose the issue:

1. **Check the SEED Dashboard**: Start by investigating the reason why access to certain resources is restricted. Ensure the following:

   - Your Cloudflare WARP client is connected and enrolled in the `gccgovsg` organisation.
   - The Tanium Client is installed and running on your device.

Once these conditions are met, you can access the SEED Dashboard on your GMD to further diagnose the issue with your device.

### Possible reasons for blocking

Access to SGTS resources may be blocked for the following reasons:

| **Issue** | **Description** | **Category** |
|---|---|---|
| Malware on the device | The device is infected with malware or exhibits suspicious behavior, causing it to be classified as high-risk and blocking access to SGTS. | Security |
| Incorrect Cloudflare configuration | The Cloudflare WARP client is either stopped or not enrolled in the `gccgovsg` organization, marking the device as misconfigured. | Configuration |
| Incorrect Intune configuration | Device not enrolled in the correct tenants (`SG Govt M365` or `TECHPASS`), or unable to sync with Intune, blocking access to resources. | Configuration |
| Tanium Client cannot communicate | The Tanium Client is unable to communicate with our servers, leading to blocked access due to lack of necessary status updates.| Configuration |


## Tanium issues

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Windows**

**Check for Tanium Client installation**

1. Click the Start icon on the taskbar.
2. Go to *Settings* > *Apps* and search for Tanium Client.
   
![tanium](/images/tanium-client-win.png)

3. If you are unable to find it, try to resync your Intune to install the Tanium Client on your device.

### **macOS**

**Check for Tanium Client installation**

1. Open *Terminal*.
2. Eun the following command:
   ```sudo ls /Library/Tanium/TaniumClient```
3. Enter your macOS password when prompted.
4. If you see confirmation, as shown in the image below, Tanium Client is installed on your device.
![tanium-client](/images/tanium-client-mac.png)
5. If you are unable to find it, log into Company Portal to install the Tanium Client on your device. Otherwise, you might need to re-onboard your device following the steps [here](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/onboard-device/seed-prerequisites).


<!-- tabs:end -->

## Other Tanium issues

If your device remains blocked after checking all other settings, please try to connect using a mobile hotspot and wait for 15-20 minutes for the Tanium server to find your device.

If your device is unblocked after connecting via mobile hotspot, it is likely that the firewall of the previous network you are connecting to is blocking the Tanium IPs. Whitelist the Tanium IPs to resolve this issue. The IP addresses can be found at this [link](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/tanium-ip/README) (accessible via TechPass login).
