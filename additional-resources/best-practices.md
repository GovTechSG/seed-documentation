# Best practices
This page summarises and provides a quick reference for most of the general recommendations, best practices and tips covered elsewhere in this document. These come in handy to solve many common problems.

### Apple ID and recovery keys
Make sure that you have linked your Apple ID and have your recovery keys ready before onboarding your macOS device. Based on your device settings, while onboarding, you may be prompted to restart your device a couple of times and reset device password.

For a smooth onboarding journey, it is important to link your Apple ID to your device. Please have your recovery keys ready in the event of you facing issues with resetting your password or logging in to your device.

### Update device OS to the latest version
